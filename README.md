## Project Overview
This project is a Medical Test Record Management System implemented in MIPS assembly language. It efficiently stores, manages, and retrieves medical test data for individual patients. The system operates on a text-based menu allowing users to perform various operations such as adding, searching, updating, and deleting medical test records.

## File Structure
- **main.asm**: The main file containing the menu loop and primary logic.
- **functions.asm**: Contains the definitions of various functions used for operations like adding, searching, updating, and deleting records.
- **list.asm**: Contains linked list manipulation functions and related operations.
- **testfile.txt**: The input file storing medical test records in a specific format.

## System Requirements
- **Assembler**: MIPS assembler (MARS or SPIM)
- **Platform**: Any platform capable of running the MIPS assembler
- **Editor**: Text editor or IDE supporting assembly language (e.g., VSCode, Notepad++, etc.)

## Compilation and Execution
1. **Open MARS/SPIM**: Launch the MIPS assembler of your choice.
2. **Load Files**: Load `main.asm`, `functions.asm`, and `list.asm` into the assembler.
3. **Set Input File**: Ensure `testfile.txt` is in the correct directory and accessible.
4. **Assemble and Run**: Assemble the loaded files and run the program. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system.

## System Functionality
### Menu Options
1. **Add a New Medical Test**: Adds a new medical test record after validating the input data.
2. **Search for a Test by Patient ID**:
   - Retrieve all patient tests.
   - Retrieve all abnormal patient tests.
   - Retrieve all patient tests in a specific period.
3. **Searching for Abnormal Tests**: Retrieves all abnormal tests based on the selected medical test.
4. **Average Test Value**: Computes and displays the average value of each medical test.
5. **Update an Existing Test Result**: Updates the test result for a specific record.
6. **Delete a Test**: Deletes a specific test record.
7. **Exit**: Writes data back to the file and exits the program.

### Searching Submenu
When searching by patient ID, you will encounter a submenu:
- Show all tests for a patient.
- Show all abnormal tests for a patient.
- Show all tests in a specific period.
- Return to the main menu.

## Error Handling
The system includes error handling for various scenarios:
- Invalid file name.
- Searching for non-existent tests or patients.
- Invalid input data types.

## Data Validation
The system performs data validation to ensure proper input data types:
- Patient ID: Must be a 7-digit integer.
- Test Date: Must follow the format `YYYY-MM`.
- Test Result: Must be a floating-point number.
